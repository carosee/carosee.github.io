      <h1>Hello there!</h1>
      <p>My name is Carolyn. I'm a third year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Molecular/Cell Biology and Computer Science. 
      I have a lot of interests but no real plans and I'm still trying to figure out what I want out of life, what I want out of my education and what I want to do with the knowledge and skills I've been given.
      I also haven't quite figured out what I want to do with this little bit of internet space that I have here... stay tuned!
      </p><p>
      I'm in the process of building this webpage and adding content bit by bit whenever I can find the time to, but you can always <a href="mailto:csy@berkeley.edu">email me</a>!</p>
